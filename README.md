This program will read the keystrokes of the user and mail them to an email along with IP address (Public/local) , username, time, system information ,saved WIFI passwords etc. . Moreover, the program will automatically run on startup. USE the program for educational purposes only so you can get more knowledge about C++. And how such programs work.. I WONT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU CAUSE... USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.. If possible improve on it too .. Thanks..
