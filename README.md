# Keylogger-and-Spyware-tool-C-
This program will read the keystrokes of the user and mail them to an email along with IP address (Public/local) , username, time, system information ,saved WIFI passwords etc. I will disguise the exe file as you want too (Rename it accordingly) don't do that yourself . Moreover, the program will automatically run on startup. I will give you the source code for the program for educational purposes only so you can get more knowledge about C++. And how such programs work.. I WONT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU CAUSE... USE AT YOUR OWN RISK..
